# Weather Analysis for Surfs Up
## Overview of the Analysis. Purpose of the analysis is to research how weather may affect the viability of opening a combination Surf shop and shake business.
### Results. The differnces in temperatures between June and December are not as dramatic as you might expect. The avergaes are 75 in June and 71 in December with highs of 85 in June and 83 in December. The standard deviations are also quite similar.
### Summary. From a temperature perspective the difference between June and December are minimal which would be favorable for a surf and shake business. I would want to do two additional analysis. First I would want to look at hotel occupancy rates to see if there are any patterns that would adversley affect this potential new business. Secondly, a precipitation analysis should be done to see if there are any extensive rainy seasons that could be difficult for a business of this type.
